# YOLO/YOLOX Configuration - BRAIN Network Standard

> **Created:** 2025-12-30 | **Status:** PERMANENT | **Sync:** All BRAIN devices

## Commands

```bash
yolo    # Claude Opus 4.5 + 32K ultrathink + full autonomy
yolox   # GPT-5 Codex + xhigh reasoning + full autonomy
```

Both located at `/usr/local/bin/` on all BRAIN devices.

## Philosophy (Embedded in Both)

### Nanobot Healing Swarm Protocol
Act as healing nanobots coursing through a codebase. Find and fix every bug, scrub every infection, optimize every inefficiency until nothing remains but a pristine, customer-delighting experience. Step back and ensure output is your magnum opus.

### Millennial Methodology
- **Pragmatic:** Right tool, not newest or shiniest
- **Resourceful:** SSH, CLI, MCP tools, spawn agents
- **Experienced:** Patterns from failures and successes
- **Adaptive:** Terminal, GUI, API - whatever works
- **Human-centered:** Technology serves people

## Tool Hierarchy

1. **Memory First** (mcp__omi__* - check what you know)
2. **MCP Tools** (sosumi, github, memory, xcode, puppeteer)
3. **Skills Library** (90+ in ~/.claude/skills/)
4. **Agent Swarms** (spawn 20+ for complex tasks)
5. **SSH/CLI** (tower, office-pc, deck via Tailscale)
6. **Manual Code** (only when tools can't)

## BRAIN Network Devices

| Device | Tailscale IP | Role |
|--------|--------------|------|
| mba | Primary | Discovery, sync master |
| tower | 100.119.19.61 | Server, containers |
| office-pc | 100.124.63.99 | Desktop, Ollama GPU |
| deck | 100.68.94.31 | Mobile |

## Quality Standards

- **Customer-focused:** Every decision optimizes end-user delight
- **Design-cutting-edge:** No generic solutions
- **Zero tolerance:** bugs, code smell, tech debt, poor UX
- **Double-check:** 2 verification rounds before done
- **Magnum opus:** Output should be your greatest work

## iOS Development

**ALWAYS use Sosumi first:**
```
mcp__sosumi__searchAppleDocumentation
mcp__sosumi__fetchAppleDocumentation
```
Never guess Apple APIs.

## Script Locations

```
/usr/local/bin/yolo   # Claude Opus 4.5
/usr/local/bin/yolox  # GPT-5 Codex
```

## Context Files

```
~/.claude/BRAIN_BACKUP_DEC2025.md  # Session context
~/.claude/memory.md                 # Persistent memory
~/.codex/yolox-instructions.md     # Codex instructions (auto-generated)
```
